## VideoGame BalloonPlayers

### General information:

A video game consists of two players floating using 100 helium balloons. The players shoot pellets at each otherâ€™s balloons and after 10 minutes the player with the most balloons left wins. The game function balloonAttack takes two Player instances, calculates the balloons left for each player after 10 minutes (using the hitsPerMinute property) and returns the name of the winner. If the result is a tie, it returns the string 'Tie'.
